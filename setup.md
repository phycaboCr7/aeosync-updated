## Key Authentication Fixes

### Sign-In Success Message

## Troubleshooting

### If you get dependency errors:
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### If you get TypeScript errors:
```bash
# Install types
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom
```

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. Check your Supabase project is active
2. Verify environment variables are correct
3. Ensure OAuth providers are configured in Supabase dashboard

### If you still experience lag:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure you're using the optimized Spline utilities

## Features Working Now

3. Customize the UI and branding
4. Deploy to your preferred platform

## What's Different from Original

1. **Authentication**: Now uses real Supabase auth instead of mock localStorage
2. **Performance**: Spline integration optimized to prevent lag
3. **Messages**: Correct success messages for sign-in vs sign-up
4. **Security**: Proper session management and OAuth handling
5. **Code Quality**: Removed duplicates and improved error handling

The application should now run smoothly without the previous lag and authentication issues!
